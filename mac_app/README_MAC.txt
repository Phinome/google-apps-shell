GASI is a graphical user interface for GAS and GAM.  It allows
administrators to programmatically execute commands from GAM and GAS
without having to write a bash script. Some use cases include...
  * Changing every user's signature to a custom signature including their email address.
  * Moving every user from one domain to another, then removing the old user alias.
  * Creating resource calendars from a CSV file containing calendar resource information.
  * ...and any other interesting combination of Google Apps API commands.

To run GASI on Mac OS X, double click on gasi.app.
