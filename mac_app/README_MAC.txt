GASI is a graphical user interface for GAS.  It allows
administrators to programmatically execute commands from GAS
without having to write a bash script. Some use cases include...
  * Changing every user's signature to a custom signature including their email address.
  * Moving every user from one domain to another, then removing the old user alias.
  * ...and many other interesting combination of Google Apps API commands.

To run GASI on a Mac, double click on gasi.app.
